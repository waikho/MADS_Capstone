# README FOR CAPASTONE PROJECT BY KCT CAPITAL

## Introduction
**Can retail traders beat the market with the help of machine learning?**

One of the most challenging aspects in stocks trading is to take emotions out of your trading decisions. Greed, FOMO (fear of missing out), overconfidence, hesitations, panic - these are often the worst enemies in trading that result in losses.

We believe that the machine and data can be our allies in trading as they are emotionless when it comes to making trading decisions. Advances in Financial Machine Learning (“AFML”, by Prof. Marco Lopez de Prado, 2018, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) is one of the most renowned textbooks on applying machine learning techniques to trading. 

This repository contains implementations and demonstrations of certain techniques introduced in AFML, using machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques.

In long run, we aim to build a fully automated trading bot that can generate consistent positive returns.
